            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PROPOSAL To Raise Forty Thousand Pounds <hi>Per Annum:</hi> Without any Trouble or Expence in <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections,</hi> And the Nation shall gain <hi>One Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Pounds</hi> Yearly, by the Payment thereof.</head>
            <head type="sub">A Repeal of the Law made in the Twenty Fifth Year of King <hi>Charles II.</hi> that took off Aliens Duties.</head>
            <p>BY a Law made in the Third Year of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 3. <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. cap. 2.</note> all Persons that are not the Natural-Born Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> are injoyned the Payment of Aliens Duties, notwithstanding Denization or Naturalization by Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>BY a Law made in the same Year, it is Enacted, That whosoever shall Enter, or cause to be Enter'd and Goods in any other Merchants Name than the true Merchant-Owner of the same,<note place="margin">3 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. c. 7.</note> he shall Forfeit his Goods, be Imprison'd, and Fin'd at the King's Pleasure.</p>
            <p>IN the Second and Third Years of <hi>Edward</hi> VI. it is Enacted,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 2. &amp; 3. <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 22.</note> That if any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son shall Enter any Goods, whereby the King shall lose this Custom, her shall Forfeit all his Goods and Chattels Personal; One Moiety to the King, the other to him that shall Sue for the same.</p>
            <p>IN the First Year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Aliens Duties are called,<note place="margin">Anno <hi>1.</hi> Eliz. cap. <hi>13.</hi>
               </note> the Ancient Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of the Crown, and it is there Enacted, That if any Person shall Ship any Goods up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Foreign Bottom, he shall pay Aliens Duties.</p>
            <p>BY these good Laws, our <hi>English</hi> Merchandize and Navigation was preserved; which are render'd ineffectual by the aforesaid Law, which took off Aliens Duties; and our <hi>English</hi> Merchandize and Navigation to <hi>Holland, Flanders, Germany, Dant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zick,</hi> &amp;c. is hereby almost totaly lost. So that an Exact Payment of Aliens Duties will undoubtedly advance the foresaid Sum of <hi>Forty Thousand Pounds per Annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BY This Law the Merchant-Alien is upon a better foot than the <hi>English</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant. At <hi>Danzick,</hi> an <hi>English</hi> Merchant is not permitted to Sell his Goods to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers coming into the Town, but to the Burgers themselves; when the Merchants of <hi>Dantzick</hi> can send for their Goods to <hi>England</hi> upon as easie Terms as the <hi>English.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>English</hi> Merchant at <hi>Hambro</hi> can't sent his Goods out of the Town to any of the great Marts in <hi>Germany;</hi> when the Merchants of <hi>Hambro</hi> and <hi>Breme</hi> can send to <hi>England</hi> for their Goods, and have them as Cheap as the <hi>English</hi> Merchant, and then send them up to those Marts, which is now practised.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchant can hereby imploy a Stock in <hi>England</hi> by an Agent of his, living in a Garret, at a Packer's House (and pay to Taxes, when the Burthen is very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy upon the Native Subject) and Under-Trade the <hi>English</hi> Merchant.</p>
            <p>By this Alteration our <hi>English</hi> Manufactures have been much debased, to the lessening their Consumption abroad, and many severe Losses have fallen upon our Manufacturers.</p>
            <p n="1">I. BY the Repeal of this Law <hi>English</hi> Merchants will be incouraged to Trade again, which instead of <hi>One per Cent,</hi> (which is now the <hi>Dutch</hi> Commission) can't be supposed to bring less than Six <hi>per Cent.</hi> Profit to our own Nation, which will soon make up above <hi>Fifty Thousand Pounds per Annum</hi> profit to our own Nation.</p>
            <p n="2">II. OUR <hi>English</hi> Ships will hereby Earn Fifty Thousand Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> more than they now do. Not one <hi>English</hi> Ship in Fifty is now imploy'd in carrying our Plantation Goods, Woollen-Manufactures, Lead, Tin, Leather, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to <hi>Holland, Breme, Flanders</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi> The Imployment of Ten Thousand Seamen will hereby be gained, which will be as servicable to the Nation upon any Extraordinary Occasion, as if kept in the Kings Pay; with many other Advantages, <hi>Which is Humbly Offered to the Consideration of the Parliament.</hi>
